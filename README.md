# 🎨 React Task Manager & API Explorer

## 🚀 Features
- **Task Manager**: Add, complete, delete, and filter tasks. Tasks persist in localStorage.
- **API Explorer**: Fetches and displays posts from JSONPlaceholder with search, pagination, loading, and error states.
- **Reusable Components**: Button, Card, Navbar, Footer, Layout, and more.
- **Theme Switcher**: Toggle between light and dark mode using Tailwind's dark mode and React Context.
